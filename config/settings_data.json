One of the reasons eating healthier is so difficult is because people have to make that healthy-minded decision 21+ times a week. We think that by allowing our clients to simply choose their healthy meals once a week, they are able to make one conscious, positive decision for themselves, and eliminate the stresses many people face when it comes to selecting healthier choices every day. Imagine a life where there is no more asking yourself, “what’s for breakfast\/lunch\/dinner?” – and that’s because your next meal is already there ready for you in your fridge. Now, that’s utopia!<\/p><p>Equally important, because we are a weekly service, we are able to source exactly the amount of ingredients we need for that week. This means that the produce we use is harvested as close as possible (and sometimes even the same day) to when our chefs prepare your meals, allowing us to ensure that we use the very freshest ingredients. In addition, with the way we have set up our logistics and our source-exactly-as-much-as-needed model, our weekly service allows us to eliminate the waste you would often find with on-demand services or restaurants and therefore, we can lessen our environmental impact.<\/p><p>Finally, a core reason why we started Sprinly is because we wanted to spread honestly healthy meals to areas where it is difficult to find. So instead of opening a restaurant in one location, we decided to make delivery a central part of our business, so location will no longer stop someone from living a healthier, happier life.<\/p>"}},"93661782-a653-41fe-bd44-b0b12de1ac12":{"type":"rich-text","settings":{"title":"Our Meals","text":"","align_text":"left"}},"14d8aa62-07d9-47a1-bcb0-26e59b4f2e41":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What do you mean by “nutritionist-approved”?","text":"<p>Great question! One of the core reasons we founded Sprinly was because we felt like there were too many places using “healthy” as just a marketing word and that bothered us. We wanted to do it differently, so we design each dish with nutrition in mind first. We believe that you don’t need all the bad, processed ingredients to make food taste good, which is why we’re focused on bringing out amazing flavors in all our dishes with clean, wholesome ingredients. That is why our chefs work hand-in-hand with nutritionists and a doctor focused on plant-based nutrition in designing our meals to ensure that your meals are honestly nutritious & delicious, all packed with good macro and micronutrients.<\/p><p>For example, Vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron, so one of the many things we try to do is combine something full of iron, like spinach, with something packed with Vitamin C, like freshly squeezed lemon juice. This is just an example of many things we’re constantly thinking about at Sprinly to make sure each meal is not only incredibly delicious but also incredibly nutritious.<\/p>"}},"e599e8ce-b253-47f8-ad83-a6f44fb9ac2c":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What is Sprinly's philosophy on healthy food?","text":"<p>We believe that the healthiest diet is a well-balanced one full of variety and rooted in eating clean, whole foods, with an emphasis on plants. It all starts with organic fruits and vegetables packed with nutrients and antioxidants. We also love protein-packed, iron-filled legumes along with nutrient-dense grains to round out many of our meals. In addition, we keep oil and sodium at a minimum, and we never use refined sugars or sweeteners. Instead, we use simple, clean ingredients to add flavor to all our meals. We believe a strong balance of macro and micronutrients allows your body to perform at an optimal level, leaving you feeling energized, both mentally and physically, all day long.<\/p>"}},"a1dc9a65-4ca6-4482-8dbd-72eb9702e23f":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Are your ingredients organic?","text":"<p>Quality is the top priority for us at Sprinly!

On average, our meals range from 14 oz – 20 oz (salads naturally tend to be a little lighter than others, though we provide larger containers for salads).
